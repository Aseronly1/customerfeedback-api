# customerfeedback-api
Legacy PHP + MySQL API written in Slim Framework 3 to read customer information from a fictional CRM backed up by a MySQL database.

Application settings are in ``src/settings.php`` and they are populated using environment variables that are stored in your Web App's App Settings.

Launching the root of the website will initiate the connection to the database and create the required tables and sample data.
